This sequence diagram shows how the system reloads a previously saved test suite execution result so it can be viewed again without re-running the tests.
The process begins when the UI requests to load a specific result file.
The Coordinator handles this message by calling the ResultsManager, which reads the serialized data from the file system and reconstructs a TestSuiteRunResult object through deserialization.
Once the result object is created, it is returned to the Coordinator and then passed back to the UI, where it can be displayed to the user as a summary of success rates, test outcomes, or any other stored information.
The diagram emphasizes the separation of responsibilities: the UI only initiates the action, the Coordinator manages the operation, the ResultsManager performs the load logic, and the file system provides the stored data.

Key sequence points:
The UI sends a loadResults(file) message to the Coordinator.
The Coordinator delegates the loading operation to the ResultsManager.
The ResultsManager accesses the file system to read the stored serialized data.
The serialized data is deserialized into a TestSuiteRunResult object.
The completed result object is returned first to the Coordinator and then to the UI.
The UI displays the loaded result content without running any tests again.
This feature enables quick review and comparison of stored test execution outcomes.
