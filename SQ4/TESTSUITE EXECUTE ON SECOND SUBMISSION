This sequence diagram illustrates how the system runs the same test suite on a second folder of student submissions, typically representing a resubmission.
The UI initiates the action by selecting a test suite and the second submission directory.
The Coordinator begins by retrieving the appropriate TestSuite object from the list of available test suites.
It then loads all programs from the new folder using the ListOfPrograms component. For each program, the Coordinator attempts to compile the student's code; if compilation succeeds, the program is executed against every test case in the selected TestSuite.
Each execution produces a TestResult, which is recorded for later analysis. Once all programs and test cases have been processed, the Coordinator sends the complete set of results back to the UI for display.
This diagram mirrors the Version-1 execution process but applies it to a different folder, enabling comparison between two different student submissions.

Key sequence points:
The UI requests execution using executeTestSuite(name, path2).
The Coordinator retrieves the appropriate TestSuite.
The second submission folder is loaded as a new ListOfPrograms.
For each program, the Coordinator attempts compilation and handles failures.
Successful programs are run against every test case in the TestSuite.
A TestResult is created for each test case execution.
Final execution outcomes are sent back to the UI for summary display.
Enables fair comparison between original submission and resubmission results.
