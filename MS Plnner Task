This folder contains the design artifacts created before coding, as required in the assignment instructions.

These diagrams reflect our current codebase and show the planned modifications needed to support the new features (storing results, reloading files, comparing results, multi-file submissions, etc.).
What’s Included:
Updated Class Diagram
Shows the existing classes plus the new responsibilities and relationships needed for the added features. The diagram preserves the structure of the original design so the evolution of the system is visible.

Sequence Diagrams
Each sequence diagram illustrates how the system will handle a specific new feature:
Running a test suite and storing results
Running the test suite on another folder
Reloading and displaying results
Comparing two result files
Detecting and running multi-file Java submissions

Purpose of the Diagrams is,
These diagrams were created before changing any code, following the instructor’s requirement to plan the design first.
They show:
How new features integrate with the existing system
Which classes are affected
How objects will interact during each operation
