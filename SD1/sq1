This sequence diagram illustrates how the system compares two previously saved test suite execution results—typically representing the first and second student submissions.
The UI initiates the comparison request, and the Coordinator orchestrates the process by calling the ResultsManager twice to load both result files.
Each load operation involves reading serialized data from the file system and reconstructing a TestSuiteRunResult object.
Once both result sets are obtained, the Coordinator extracts and computes success rates for every student found in either file, creates a Comparison object for each student, and applies rules for special cases such as missing submissions or compilation failures.
Finally, the Coordinator returns a structured comparison list to the UI, which displays the success rates side-by-side.

Key sequence points:
The UI sends a compareResults(file1, file2) message to the Coordinator.
The Coordinator sequentially loads both files through the ResultsManager.
Each load action triggers file system access and deserialization of results.
The Coordinator computes success rates from both TestSuiteRunResult objects.
A Comparison object is created for each student to represent old vs. new outcomes.
Special cases are handled: missing resubmissions, missing first submission, compilation errors, or no tests run.
The Coordinator returns the comparison results to the UI for final display.
